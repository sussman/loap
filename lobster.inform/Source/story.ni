"Lobsters On A Plane" by Ben and Jack

The story headline is "Parboiled crustaceans at 30,000 feet".
The release number is 3.
The story creation year is 2010.
The story genre is "Disaster".

The story description is "A flying tube of riveted aluminum the length of a football field, a swarm of angry carnivorous lobsters, a seething mass of frightened mortal passengers, and a renowned High Wizard who you sworn to protect. Hope you brought a bib."

The intro-text is a text that varies.  Intro-text is "There is an actinic flash. The seat belt signs illuminate. On the overhead speakers, the pilot mechanically reassures the passengers that the minor turbulence is no cause for concern. A second, more abrupt crash and the plane lurches. Air masks drop. An overhead baggage bin flies open, and lobsters pour out. Ignoring the passengers in your section, you let the food cart topple forward, the potatoes au gratin mixing with the fettuccine and mango compote. You climb towards the lavatory and throw the latch from 'vacant' to 'occupied.' The plane revolves slowly -- pushing you towards the wall -- even as the sudden loss of altitude makes you feel lighter.[paragraph break]".

Use full-length room descriptions, american dialect and the serial comma.

			try silently switching score notification off;

	Need this until parchement is patched to accomodate the default "ENTER"
	change right entry to "SPACE = Select".]
			change wand counter to a random number between 0 and 5.

[Note - generating fake banner text. Not a generally good practice, but making an exception in this case to add the fake "SD" on the released version. Presumably, this game will be run by people who are very familiar with I7 and will tolerate all of the inside gags and historical references.]

Rule for printing the banner text:
	say "[bold type]Lobsters On A Plane[roman type][line break]Parboiled crustaceans at 30,000 feet by Ben and Jack[line break]Release [release number] / Serial number 100403 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) SD[line break]Type [quotation mark]help[quotation mark] for instructions.[paragraph break]" instead.

	if R is not the number of rows in the source:
		decrease R by one;
	let T be a random number between 1 and R;
	choose row T in the source;
	increase the times-used entry by one;
	say "[verbage entry]".

			-- 7: say "Two years of deep cover as a stewardess. A bloody stewardess! Waiting hand and foot on these sink holes of attentions. And for what? The biggest failure of your career.

The boss continues brashly, [quotation mark]Boys, I think tonight's main dish is... sushi![paragraph break]The boss looks back at his mob, and there is a murmur of agreement. Before the boss is done gloating, however, the  fish pulls a modified Kalashnikov assault rifle from its bulky trenchcoat.[paragraph break]One of the hench-lobsters barely has time to say, [quotation mark]Boss, watch out for the cod piece![quotation mark] before the silver-scaled avenger lets loose with a barrage of phosphor-tipped rounds, which both cook and mince the lobster meat into a tasty salad. The passengers in the business section, who are accustomed to such things, merely assume it is the inflight meal, and quickly polish off the remains of the former gang.[paragraph break]";

		move the cod to Limbo2;
	if the spiny lobster is in the location:

Let me know when you've taken care of spiky[or]Oh, he's still around.

Ordinarily, a welcome refuge from the demanding mortal customers who need to use planes to move from one place to another, but now a safe haven from the carnivorous lobsters infesting the plane.

The lobster continues dancing for another half minute until its nervous system catches up with the situation, and collapses to the floor. A moment later, the spiny lobster vanishes in a magical haze.

Just above the business class is the bulkhead that leads to the cockpit.[if unvisited][paragraph break]And clearly the vast mass of hungry lobsters have decided to make a final stand against you here.

You make an effort to slow down and appear dignified, [quotation mark]I was sent by the Republic to see that you reach the Summit safely.[quotation mark][paragraph break]Meretzky appears amused, [quotation mark]Yeah? And how's that going?[quotation mark] He deftly flicks his wand and the giant lobster that was sneaking up on you disappears in a puff of smoke. Becoming more serious, he explains, [quotation mark]I'm afraid we're surrounded by an antimagic shell. Not even [italic type]I[roman type] am powerful enough to penetrate it. Our only hope is to get a message out to the Republic... You lead, I'll take up the rear. You can never be too careful with grues and lobsters, you know.[quotation mark][paragraph break]";

After going 	when the location is first class and first class is unvisited:

His salt-and-pepper ponytail flaps behind him in arising maelstrom. You have only heard tell of him in legends, but there is no doubt in your mind that the figure is none other than Don Woods, one of the Fathers of the Genre.[paragraph break]Even with his great power, Woods is struggling to hold the portal open. In each of his mighty fists, he has gathered bundles of ethernet cords, which lead away in every direction. Woods calls upon the power of the Internet itself, tapping into the raw flow of energy from the IFwiki, IFDb, IFMud, and Baf's guide, Brass Lantern, and R.A.I.F.  He reaches out through the thousands of works of interactive fiction in the repository, all the way back the original Adventure. He draws on the pleasure and sense of challenge felt by the millions who have ever played a text adventure, and channels it into the whirling vortex. As sweat pours from his brow, he beckons you forward.[paragraph break]".;

Around him, people in the crowd hold each others[apostrophe] hands, contributing power to his spell. One word is repeated over and over, quietly at first, but soon building to a thunderous roar. Finally, the word can no longer be restrained. It breaks loose and reverberates, filling the room, and then flooding outward in every direction. It is an ancient word, of great power, the oldest of the spells: [quotation mark]xyzzy![quotation mark][paragraph break]Banality is banished. The community is saved.[paragraph break][italic type]And thus begins the Third Age of Interactive Fiction.[roman type][paragraph break]Jason Scott, dressed in fine Victorian regalia, waves his hand and a silence falls over the crowd.

Chapter Player

The player is in the lavatory. The description of the player is "Four-hundred and eighty-six years, and you look like a supermodel[if the player does not wear the flight attendant uniform] (even more so, without your clothes)[end if]. That's partly due to your inherently superior breeding, and partly attributable to the plastic surgery, cybernetic implants and magical enhancements all courtesy of The Republic."
