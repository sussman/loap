_"A flying tube of riveted aluminum the length of a football field, a swarm of angry carnivorous lobsters, a seething mass of frightened mortal passengers, and a renowned High Wizard who you sworn to protect. Hope you brought a bib."_

This game is a humorous-fantasy text adventure (["interactive fiction"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)) originally written for  a "speed" competition.  It was mostly written in 8 hours, then completed haphazardly over the course of a week.  It's decidedly less polished then our other games, but then that's sort of the point of speed-entries.

It's written in the [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) programming language, and compiles into bytecode that can be executed on a [Z-machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) interpreter.

(Because the source text straddles the fuzzy line between "code" and "fiction", we've released it on the Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - Share Alike 3.0 license.)

## To play the game OFFLINE ##

  1. Grab the latest .zblorb (or .z8/.z5) file from the Download bubble to the right.
  1. Grab a nice interpreter to play the game:  either [Zoom](http://www.logicalshift.co.uk/mac/Zoom-1.1.4.dmg) for Mac, [WinFrotz](http://ifarchive.plover.net/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/frotz/WindowsFrotz2002.zip) for Windows, or [Gargoyle](http://ifarchive.flavorplex.com/indexes/if-archiveXinterpreters-multiXgargoyle.html) for Linux.  There are also interpreters out there for iPhone ("Frotz" in the AppStore), Android Phone ("Twisty" in the Market), and other esoteric platforms as well.
  1. Load the game into the interpreter to play.


_If you've never played interactive fiction before_:  read this simple [crib sheet](http://www.microheaven.com/IFGuide/step3.html) to give you a sense of how the command parser works.  It's a limited vocabulary, fairly easy to master.
